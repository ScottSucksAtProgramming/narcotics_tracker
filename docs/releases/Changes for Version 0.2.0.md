## Create Custom Reporting Periods
State and Federal reporting happens twice a year. Sorting controlled substance inventory changes into the correct reporting periods will make inventory management much easier. 

You can use the periods module to build a reporting_periods table, define your own custom reporting periods and save them to the table and edit or delete them as necessary.
