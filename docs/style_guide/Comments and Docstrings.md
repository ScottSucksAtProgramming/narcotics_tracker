## Docstring Format

* Always use the three double-quote `”””` format for docstrings (per PEP 257). 
* A docstring should be organized as a summary line (one physical line not exceeding 80 characters) terminated by a period, question mark, or exclamation point. 
* When writing more (encouraged), this must be followed by a blank line, followed by the rest of the docstring starting at the same cursor position as the first quote of the first line.

## Modules
* Files should start with a docstring describing the contents and usage of the module.


```python
"""One line module summary.

Module Description. Module uses and examples.
"""
```
