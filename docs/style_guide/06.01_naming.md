Naming items in code is important when it comes to readability. Care should be taken to choose names which help the reader understand what the itemâ€™s purpose or function is.

Naming can be difficult and may change over various iterations of the codebase. As better names occur replace less descriptive names.

## 6.1.1 - Packages and Module Names
Modules names should use `snake_case`.

Package names should use `lowercase` names and avoid the use of underscores.

## 6.1.2 - Class Names

Class names should describe the objects they create (or their general purpose if they are a static class) and should contain a **noun**. (i.e. `Medication`, `Container`)

Class names should use the `CapWords` style.

## 6.1.3 - Function (and Method) Names
Functions which perform tasks and operations. Functions have names which contain a **verb** to make them immediately identifiable (i.e. `calculate_concentration()`).

Functions which only return a value like a boolean can use short phrases with adjectives for their name (i.e. `created_date_is_none()`).

Function names should be specific but they can use the context from which they are called to assist their name (i.e. `create()` is a bad name but `Medication.create()` is acceptable if the function is always called using this structure).

Function names shoud use the `snake_case` style.

## 6.1.4 - Variable and Property Names
Variables and properties hold data. Their names should describe the kind of data being stored and contain a **noun**. (i.e. `fentanyl.dose`)

Variables which contain a boolean value can use short phrases with an **adjective** as their name. (i.e. `medicaion_status_is_active`)

Variables should use the `snake_case` style with an exception made for *constants* which should use the `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES` style.
