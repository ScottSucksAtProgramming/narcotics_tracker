Special Thanks:
    Mom, thanks for being my software design mentor and entertaining my 
    onslaught of questions.

Purpose:
    Welcome to the Narcotics Tracker! This software is designed to assist 
    controlled substance agents working at EMS agencies with inventory 
    tracking and periodic reporting of controlled substance activities to 
    their governing agencies.

Motivation:
    I am a controlled substance agent working in New York State. The tracking 
    of controlled substances is complicated and requires multiple forms and 
    processes. I have wished for a single place where all of that information 
    can be stored and easily accessed. This software is intended to fill that 
    need.

Current Completed Features:

    Medication Module - Creates and stores medication objects in the database.

    Database Module - Handles communication with the SQLite3 database.

    Builders Package - Assists with the building of complex objects.

    Enums Package - Contains the enumerated types used in the software.

    Utils Package - Contains utility functions used in the software.

Planned Features:

    Inventory Tracking (v0.2.0)

    Lot Tracking (v0.3.0)

    Order Tracking (v0.4.0)

    Destruction Tracking (v0.5.0)

    User and Agent Management (v0.6.0)

    Report Generation (v0.7.0)

    Console Interface (v0.8.0)

    GUI Interface (v1.0.0)
